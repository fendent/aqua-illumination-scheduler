This app allows you to import and edit an Aqua Illumination light schedule and then export it back out in the format that the lights understand.
Editing the schedule on your phone is difficult and doesn't allow for some basic features like:
 - Shifting the schedule forward or backwards in time to match when you want the lights to be on
 - Increasing/decreasing the intensity of a spectrum overall

The app is written in svelte and sits on top of vite.  To run it locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
